We are working on modernizing this pdocs project.

We are working on removing the dependency on the `hug` package and using the `typer` package instead to implement the CLI.

## Current State Analysis

The current implementation uses `hug` in two main places:

1. **CLI Implementation**: In `pdocs/cli.py`, hug is used to create a command-line interface that exposes the following functions from `pdocs.api`:
   - `as_html`
   - `as_markdown`
   - `server`

2. **Server Function**: In `pdocs/api.py`, the `server()` function uses hug to create a web server for documentation browsing.

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Replace CLI Implementation (pdocs/cli.py)

1. **Create New CLI Implementation with Typer**:
   - Replace the current hug-based CLI with a new Typer-based implementation
   - Ensure all command parameters are preserved exactly as they are
   - Set up the same command structure to maintain backward compatibility

2. **Update Entry Point**:
   - Modify `pyproject.toml` to use the new Typer app (already points to `pdocs.cli:app`)

3. **Update Tests**:
   - Adapt `tests/test_cli.py` to use Typer's testing utilities instead of hug's

### Phase 2: Update Server Function in api.py

1. **Replace hug Server with Alternative**:
   - Remove hug usage in the `server()` function
   - Implement equivalent functionality using a simple HTTP server or a lightweight framework like FastAPI

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification

1. **Run Tests**:
   - Run all tests to ensure functionality is maintained
   - Fix any issues that arise

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test the CLI commands manually to verify they work as expected
   - Test the server functionality to ensure it still works properly

## Implementation Details

### CLI Implementation

The current CLI is very simple and just registers API functions with hug. Here's how we'll migrate it to Typer:

```python
# Current implementation (hug-based)
import hug
from pdocs import api, logo

cli = hug.cli(api=hug.API(__name__, doc=logo.ascii_art))
cli(api.as_html)
cli(api.as_markdown)
cli(api.server)
```



I set up an older version of the project that still used hug and python 3.8 here: /Users/christo/workspace/LVS/ws/SandsB2B/tools/pdocs-1.2.1

You can experiment with the CLI of the 1.2.x version by doing this in the terminal:
```
cd /Users/christo/workspace/LVS/ws/SandsB2B/tools/pdocs-1.2.1 && source $RC_DIR/python.rc && pdocs <args>
```

# Clarifying Questions

1. Q: I notice that in the pyproject.toml
file, there's already a typer dependency included. Is it installed and ready to use, or does it need to be added?

A: I added the dependency while updating the python version because hug does not work with anything newer than Python 3.8

2. Q: The current CLI implementation is very minimal in cli.py, but the API implementations in api.py
contain more complex functionality. Should the typer CLI maintain the exact same function signatures/parameters or are there any improvements you'd like to make?

A: The CLI needs to be identical from a consumer perspective. If hug is used for the API we need to look at that in more detail

3. Q: Are there any specific typer features you want to take advantage of (like rich terminal output, auto-completion, etc.)?

A: No - vanilla use - only the minimum amount to support the exact same CLI as the consumer is used to

4. Q: How should error handling be implemented in the new CLI? Typer's approach differs from hug's.

A: For error handling you will have to show me what you mean. However if the current implementation does not do good error handling we do not need to do anything special for the typer conversion


5. Q: I see that server functionality is part of the API. Should the server functionality remain the same in terms of implementation details?

A: `server` has a dependency on `hug` We need to plan to rewrite the implementation to use a simple HTTP server.

6. Q: Would you like to maintain backward compatibility with any existing code that might use the current API structure?

A: I do not understand your continued interest in the API ... If it is not dependent on `hug` it is outside the scope of your task

7. Q: The current CLI entry point in pyproject.toml is set to pdocs.cli:app, but the hug implementation doesn't define an app variable. Do you want to follow typer's conventional naming or make other adjustments?

A: The `pdocs.cli:app` is a placeholder - do what makes sense for a typer CLI

8. Q: For the server rewrite, do you prefer a standard Python `http.server`, or is using a minimal FastAPI (or Flask) implementation acceptable?

A: standard Python `http.server` - we need to keep the dependencies simple UNLESS there is a compelling argument for FastAPI AND FastAPI will do well with service static content

9. Q: Should the serverâ€™s API endpoints and behavior remain exactly the same, or is there any flexibility to change the API surface (e.g., response format, endpoints)?

A: Keep the implementation backwards compatible. The tasks does not call for changes.

10. Q: Should documentation (README, help texts, etc.) be updated as part of this rewrite, or only code changes?

A: Yes and also the tests need to be fixed after the rewrite so factor that into the plan

12. Q: Is there a timeline or priority for this migration, or can it be done incrementally?

A: Incrementally but this is not a plan to launch the space shuttle. We are modifying a few python files so get on with it
