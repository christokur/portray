# Portray Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the specifications and requirements for "Portray", a Python documentation website generation tool. Portray is designed to create
comprehensive documentation websites for Python projects by combining manual documentation with auto-generated API reference documentation.

This document serves as the central reference for all stakeholders involved in the development, implementation, and maintenance of Portray. It defines the product's purpose,
features, technical requirements, and success criteria.

## 2. Product Overview

Portray is a library and command-line tool that generates complete documentation websites for Python projects with minimal configuration. Unlike traditional documentation tools
that focus solely on API documentation or require extensive setup, Portray combines the power of MkDocs for rendering beautiful documentation websites with pdocs for automatic API
reference generation.

The tool operates on the principle of "zero-configuration" - it can generate a comprehensive documentation website by simply running `portray` in a Python project directory. It
automatically discovers project structure, includes README files, processes manual documentation, and generates API references, all while producing a professional, searchable
website.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Goals

- Create a documentation tool that requires zero configuration to produce professional documentation websites
- Combine manual documentation (Markdown files) with auto-generated API documentation seamlessly
- Provide both static HTML generation and live development server capabilities
- Enable one-command deployment to GitHub Pages and other hosting platforms
- Make documentation generation an effortless part of the Python development workflow
- Support modern documentation features like search, theming, and responsive design

### 3.2 Success Metrics

- Complete documentation website generation for 95% of Python projects without any configuration
- Successful integration of manual docs and API references in a unified navigation structure
- Sub-30-second documentation generation for typical Python projects
- 90% or higher user satisfaction with generated documentation appearance and functionality
- Reduced time to publish documentation compared to manual setup of MkDocs + API documentation tools

## 4. Target Audience

### 4.1 Primary Users

- Python developers who want comprehensive project documentation websites
- Open source maintainers who need both user guides and API documentation
- Development teams requiring consistent documentation across multiple Python projects
- Technical writers working with Python codebases who need both manual and auto-generated content

### 4.2 Secondary Users

- Users of documented Python libraries who consume the generated documentation websites
- Project managers who need documentation status visibility
- Continuous integration systems that automatically generate and deploy documentation
- Documentation hosting platforms (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
